## 1. Introduction

In line with the comprehensive cybersecurity enhancement efforts undertaken by SilverLine Security, this Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes a procedural framework for crafting, executing, and overseeing an efficient Security Incident Plan. The central goal of this SOP revolves around ensuring the methodical and proficient testing of security controls, proactive identification of adversarial activities, prompt incident response, and effective mitigation within the cloud infrastructure of the client company.

## 2. Security Incident Plan

### 2.1 Objective

The Security Incident Plan is a crucial component of SilverLine Security's mission to bolster the cybersecurity posture of the client company. By embracing the NIST framework & governance, we effectively manage evolving cybersecurity risks. Each function plays a critical role in incident management: IDENTIFY and PROTECT outcomes work towards preventing and preparing for cybersecurity incidents, whereas DETECT, RESPOND, and RECOVER outcomes contribute to the discovery and management of such incidents.

### 2.2 Testing Procedures

#### Define Use Case and Scope Definition

The contracted team shall precisely define the scope of security controls and monitoring solutions subject to meticulous testing within the cloud infrastructure.

#### Defined Target Profile

SilverLine Security will define network configuration and access points which malicious intent may interdict on the security and integrity of our operations.

#### Test Plan Creation

SilverLine Security experts shall craft a comprehensive test plan, outlining methodologies, procedures, and expected outcomes for each security control and monitoring solution.

#### Testing Execution

The contracted team shall execute the test plan, simulating a spectrum of adversarial activities to assess the efficacy of controls and solutions.

#### Outcome Analysis

SilverLine Security shall meticulously analyze test results, pinpointing vulnerabilities and gaps that require prompt remediation.

#### AWS Lambda Integration Testing

Testing the integration of AWS Lambda within our incident response plan involves several critical steps. These include simulating real-world scenarios to evaluate Lambda functions' responses to security events, conducting data injection tests to identify vulnerabilities, emulating different attack vectors to assess their resilience, examining how Lambda functions interact with other security controls, monitoring network traffic during executions, scrutinizing dependencies for vulnerabilities, evaluating scalability and performance under varying loads, analyzing outcomes to pinpoint vulnerabilities, enabling email notifications to the SilverLine Security team for real-time alerts, generating comprehensive documentation of methodologies and outcomes, and proactively enhancing the incident response plan and overall cloud infrastructure security.

#### S3 Bucket Testing

We extend our evaluation to the S3 bucket, scrutinizing access controls, encryption mechanisms, and monitoring solutions. Our assessment focuses on ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data while maintaining compliance with security policies.

#### CloudWatch Testing

The evaluation of CloudWatch encompasses a meticulous review of its monitoring configuration, alerting rules, and integration with our incident response procedures. This process ensures its efficacy in promptly detecting anomalies and potential security breaches.

#### CloudTrail Testing

Our scrutiny of CloudTrail centers on its tracking and logging capabilities for API activity within the cloud environment. This step is crucial to ensure that it captures all relevant information necessary for thorough forensic analysis.

#### Wazah Implementation Testing

We conduct a thorough examination of the Wazah implementation, verifying its configuration for threat detection, incident correlation, and response automation. This assessment ensures its seamless integration with our incident response plan and enhances our overall security posture.

### 2.3 Incident Response Procedures

Incident Identification (NIST): The contracted team shall institute proactive measures for timely detection of adversarial activities through continuous monitoring, real-time alerts, and integration of threat intelligence.
